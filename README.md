Tabished is a chrome extension made by [Harsh Vats](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-vats-02b210150/), which will close all inactive tabs(specified by user) after some time(specified by user).

For example the extension comes with a default url `https://www.google.com/search?q=` and inactivity time of 3 minute.
So any url which will contain `https://www.google.com/search?q=` at the starting will be considered as a bad tab and will automatically close if you haven't visited it in the last 3 minutes.

User has the flexibility to add more urls and change their inactivity time.

All the preferences are stored across devices. Like if you use two laptops and are logged in to both the devices with same email, your preferences will be saved in the cloud so you have seamless experience.
